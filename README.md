# Final Project 3D Computer Graphics

My project is a video game that revolves around a grappling gun and movement. There are powerups and wall running and fun momentum movement implemented in it. I used some help to create my own physics so that the movement is a lot more fun. I used C# and a lot of Unity Prefabs that is provided in the unity store. It was fun to make, but I can't lie, it was hard to make. Wall running was inconsistent and implementing the grapple cooldown was annoying. I also hope to expand more on the game so that it looks more complete. But other than that, I am very happy with the result.

# How to play the game

In order to play the game, all you have to do is go to this link https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-337849. I was able to build it on Unity WebGL to make it easier to access. WASD to move, space to jump, ctrl to crouchm left click to grapple! Thats all there is to it really. There are powerups that reset the grapple cooldown and the grapple cooldown only starts after you let go of the grapple!
